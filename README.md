#  Diabetes Risk Assessment – Machine Learning Pipeline

Machine Learning pipeline for assessing diabetes risk and stratifying patients using the BRFSS 2015 dataset. This project integrates data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, clustering, and predictive modeling to support early risk detection and data-driven healthcare insights.

---

##  Project Objective

This project aims to develop a structured machine learning pipeline to assess diabetes risk and classify patients into Low, Medium, and High-risk groups.  

By leveraging predictive modeling and clustering techniques, the system demonstrates how data science can support early intervention strategies and public health decision-making.
